## üåü About Me

Hi there! I'm Abhinav Om, currently a 3rd-year undergraduate student at the Indian Institute of Information Technology (IIIT) Ranchi.
I'm passionate about turning raw data into meaningful insights and am actively working toward a career as a Data Analyst or Business Analyst.

I enjoy solving real-world problems through data, exploring trends, and drawing actionable conclusions that drive decision-making.
I'm constantly improving my skills in SQL, Excel, Python, and data visualization tools like Power BI and Tableau.
With hands-on project experience in data warehousing and analytics, I'm building a strong foundation for a future in analytics and consulting.
